# Twitter Bot

Welcome to the Twitter Bot project! This bot is designed to automatically tweet memes from specified subreddits on a regular basis. It is built using Python, and makes use of the `tweepy`, `requests` and `shutil` libraries. 

## Features
- The bot can tweet memes from multiple subreddits, selected at random.
- The bot checks for duplicates before tweeting to avoid tweeting the same meme multiple times.
- The bot checks for minimum ups and nsfw content before tweeting.

## How to use
1. Replace api_key, api_secret, bearer_token, access_token and access_token_secret with your own values.
2. Modify the subreddit list to your preference.
3. Schedule the script to run at a desired interval using a task scheduler.
